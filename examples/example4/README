./example4

21 events (event.sel) with synthetic delay times computed in a constant 
velocity model (vp=4km/s) to stations that locate both above and below the 
sources.  event.sel.noise has noise added to the inital locations. 
Uses IMOD=5 to relocate.

To rerun this example type the following commands:

../../src/hypoDD/hypoDD hypoDD.inp

To display the results with the enclosed Matlab script eqplot, open a Matlab window in this directory and type eqplot in the Matlab window. Edit the parameters at the beginning of the script to make changes to the view of the plot.
