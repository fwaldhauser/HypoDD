./example1

16 events on the northern Hayward fault near El Cerrito including catalog and cross correlation P- and S-wave data. See Figure 2 in the User Guide.  

To rerun this example type the following commands:

../../src/ncsn2pha/ncsn2pha El16.arc El16.pha
	to convert from NCSN catalog format to DD format

../../src/ph2dt/ph2dt ph2dt.inp
	to get travel time differences for pairs of earthquakes

../../src/hypoDD/hypoDD hypoDD.inp.v1
	hypoDD 1 (old) input file format
or 
../../src/hypoDD/hypoDD hypoDD.inp
	hypoDD 2.0 input file format
	to run hypoDD to get double-difference locations


To display the results with the enclosed Matlab script eqplot, open a Matlab window in this directory and type eqplot in the Matlab window. Edit the parameters at the beginning of the script to make changes to the view of the plot.
