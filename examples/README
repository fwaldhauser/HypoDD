This directory contains several example data sets that can be used to learn how to run the program package hypoDD.

The examples include the following data sets:

         # of events  catalogP  catalogS  xcorrP  xcorrS  model    region
example1      16          x          x      x       x     1D      Hayward
example2     308          x          x      x       x     1D      Calaveras 
example3     586          x          x      x       x    1D/3D    Parkfield 
example4      21         synthetic delay times  	 const V; borehole  stat
exampleXL  ~10000          x          x                    1D     LongValley

Because of the size of exampleXL, this file comes in a different package named HYPODD_moreExamples.tar.gz.

See Readme files in each directory on how to re-run the data sets. Note that 
hypoDD_2 is backwards compatible: input files created for hypoDD_1 will run 
with hypoDD_2. Each data sets includes both hypoDD_1 (hypoDD.inp.v1) and 
hypoDD_2 (hypoDD.inp) style input files.  

The program results should not depend on the various array dimensions.
The program will run if the arrays are large enough, or fail if they
are not. See hypoDD.inc for parameter description.

Note that if the arrays are not dimensioned large enough, hypoDD will
report an error stating the parameter to increase, and stop.
