./example3

586 events on the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield including catalog and 
cross correlation P- and S-wave data. Two 3D velocity models in simulps
format are included (can be used w/ hypoDD.inp.v2):
- pkf3D_PS.vel: w/ P- and S-velocities (Ref ???)
- pkf3D_P.vel: w/ P-velocities only (Thurber et al., BSSA,96,38-49,2006)

To rerun this example type the following commands:

../../src/ph2dt/ph2dt ph2dt.inp
	to get travel time differences for pairs of earthquakes

../../src/hypoDD/hypoDD hypoDD.inp.v1  
	hypoDD 1 (old) input file format (use of 1D model only)
or
../../src/hypoDD/hypoDD hypoDD.inp
	hypoDD 2.0 input file format (use of 1D or 3D model)
	to run hypoDD to get double-difference locations

To display the results with the enclosed Matlab script eqplot, open a Matlab window in this directory and type eqplot in the Matlab window. Edit the parameters at the beginning of the script to make changes to the view of the plot.
