Each subdirectory of this directory contains the source code for hypoDD
or one of the associated commands.

MAKING EXECUTABLE FILES
Each subdirectory contains a simple Makefile.  To compile and load a
program, just go to the appropriate directory and type

	make

or type 

	make 

in the current (./src) directory.

It may be necessary to modify the Makefile slightly for different
compilers.  The versions given here support the GNU g77 compiler, 
SUN's f77 compiler, and the gfortran compiler for MacOS and Linux; 

Before compiling, use the Makefiles to remove all files that can easily be
re-generated.  Type

	make clean

SYMBOLIC LINKS
Some sub-programs are used by more than one command.  In these cases,
only one file is provided and the other directories contain symbolic
links to it.
